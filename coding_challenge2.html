						<p>John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points<br>
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li> Calculate the average score for each team</li>
							<li> Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.</li>
							<li> Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)</li>
							<li> <span id="highlighter">EXTRA:</span> Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134, and 105 points. Like before log the average winner to the console. <span id="highlighter">HINT:</span> you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem. :)</li>
							<li> Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.</li>
